RENDER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - TEMPLATE

Set the following environment variables in the Render Dashboard for your service:

1) FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
   - Paste the full JSON contents of your Firebase service account file here (string). Render will store securely as an env var.
   - Alternatively, upload the serviceAccountKey.json to the project and set FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS to './serviceAccountKey.json'

2) FIREBASE_API_KEY
   - From Firebase project settings -> Web API Key

3) OPENAI_API_KEY
   - Your OpenAI secret key (starts with sk-...). Required for AI-2 features.

4) SECRET_KEY
   - A random secret string for Flask session security (e.g., generate with os.urandom)

5) DEFAULT_AI_LANG
   - 'vi' for Tiếng Việt or 'en' for English. (We will set 'vi' as you requested)

Notes:
- Do NOT commit serviceAccountKey.json or API keys to GitHub.
- If you set FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON, the app will write it to ./serviceAccountKey.json at startup (handled by the deploy script).
